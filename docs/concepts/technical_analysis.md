## What is technical Analyses

In essence, technical analysis (TA) is the process of taking a look at current market conditions, in order to predict future movements. It focuses on using a price chart to identify the trend, support and resistance, and momentum to help traders get into and out of higher probability trades.

It operates on the premise that prices move in trends, and these movements generally follow established patterns which are partly attributed to market psychology. This behavioral assumption is based on the belief that traders react in a similar fashion when faced with similar situations.

Technical analysis does not attempt to measure a crypto asset’s underlying value. It employs mathematical indicators and recognized crypto chart patterns in order to predict the probability of a future movement.

## Crypto Market Sentiment: Bulls vs Bears

Bitcoin and crypto markets move in three directions; *upwards*, *downwards*, and *sideways*. A market that is moving upwards is considered to be bullish, whereas a downwards market is bearish. A sideways market is considered range-bound or consolidating.

A bullish market means that prices of assets are rising or many people are buying. A bearish market means that prices are falling or many people are selling. Bullish and bearish represent trends of how people respond to the market.

Within a trend can be several rallies, corrections, or pullbacks where it appears to reverse, only to resume the original trend after a period of time. After all, prices do not move in a straight line. Using crypto price analysis and chart patterns can reveal these potential changes in a trend on different time frames.

## Moving Averages
Moving averages are often used together to provide a better indication of when a trend will reverse. The number of days used to calculate the moving average also differs.

Two of the more commonly used moving averages for crypto charts are the 50 day and the 200 day for identifying longer-term trend patterns and areas of support and resistance.

Adding these two indicators to a Bitcoin price chart can help to identify when prices are at the upper or lower limits of their potential movements and when a major trend reversal is in process.

When these two moving average lines cross, it is a major signal for future price movements and trend changes. They have been aptly named as follows:

* Golden Cross – occurs when the faster moving 50 day crosses above the slower 200 day. Bullish trend reversal pattern.
* Death Cross – occurs when the faster moving 50 day crosses below the slower 200 day. Bearish trend reversal pattern.

## Support and Resistance
Support and resistance levels are key concepts to understand when dealing with crypto price charts, and are one of the most widely used indicators. Markets oscillate over time so areas where prices pullback are called resistance, while bounces from a downwards movements are at support levels.

When prices repeatedly return to the same level, without breaking above it, the resistance there strengthens. Likewise in reverse, when prices fall repeatedly to the same level but not below it, the support strengthens.
